1. Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd pathfinder-ai-shine

2. Install Dependencies

3. Set Up Environment Variables
You need to create a .env file in the root of the project to store your secret keys and configuration.
Create a new file named .env in the project's root directory.
Copy the content from the example below and paste it into your new .env file.
Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

# .env file

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Application
To run both the frontend and backend servers at the same time, use the following command:

npm start

This will:
Start the Vite frontend development server (usually on http://localhost:8080).
Start the Node.js backend server (on http://localhost:5000).
Your website should now be running and fully functional on your local machine.

Available Scripts:
npm start: Runs both the frontend and backend concurrently.
npm run dev: Runs only the frontend Vite server.
npm run start:backend: Runs only the backend Node.js server.
npm run build: Builds the React application for production.
